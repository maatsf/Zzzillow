				What is Lucid Dreaming?
			</h1>

			<p>
				Lucid dreams are dreams which the dreamer is aware of dreaming. During this period, the dreamer may be able to control the environment and characters to some extent. Some people have even experienced flying!<br><br>
They say that the sky is the limit, but in Lucid Dreams... you will be Moonwalking! There will be no limit to what you can do. Flying, using magic, playing sports, swimming endlessly underwater, and even experience sexual intercourse! These are just the tip of the iceberg. Once the dreamer gets the hang of Lucid Dreaming, the easier it will be to control your own dreams. You can do whatever you want, even change the landscape itself!<br><br>
There are people who has spent years trying to gain control over their own dreams. Although there are different methods and techniques to help with Lucid Dreaming, some of them are proven to be ineffective. There is even a study that shows that having small flashing lights during your sleep will help with Lucid Dreaming. This however, is also proven to be ineffective
