				How does it work?

			<p>
				Having a pillow that allows you to control your dreams sounds magical and unrealistic. But there is science behind it. Studies have shown that there is a specific brain activity that happens in the frontal lobes. This is called the  gamma activity . This activity is present during Lucid Dreams, and is also associated with consciousness.<br><br>
A well-documented method called Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) helps with enhancing the gamma activity in the brain during sleep. What this method does is that it implements mild electrical stimulation to the head. Oh and don’t worry, this is completely safe! Once the implementation is done, Ha<br><br>
So how do we apply the tACS method with only a pillow? Well the answer is simple. We do this with the help of portable electrodes that is rechargeable. The electrodes are small and lightweight, and is almost impossible to feel once the dreamer lays down. The main device is inside the pillow, covered in fluffy cotton, making the pillow extra soft and comfortable. Unlike the other Lucid Dreaming devices, the electrodes are so small that the dreamer can sleep in any position.
