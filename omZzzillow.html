			<p>
				With Zzzillow, having Lucid Dreams has never been easier. There are already devices out there that helps with Lucid Dreaming. However, for some people, having a device on your head while sleeping can sometimes feel uncomfortable. Some of them even requires the dreamer to sleep on a certain position. This is not the case with Zzzillow, a pillow which helps with Lucid Dreaming!<br><br>
				The design is simplicity itself, a pillow and two small portable electrodes. To get started an app is required. This app will monitor your brain activity during your sleep. It can also tell if you’re having a Lucid Dream or not, and will register it in the history tab. There are multiple settings to choose from, like consciousness while dreaming.
				To start dreaming, the steps are simple:
			</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Attach the electrodes to your head</li>
					<li>Apply the preferred settings on the app</li>
					<li>Sleep and take your dreams to the next level!</li>
				</ol>
			<p>
				If it’s your first time experiencing a lucid dream, controlling it might prove to be a bit difficult at first. The most common mistake dreamers make is when they realize that they are dreaming and gets too exited, resulting in waking themselves up in the process. The best way to avoid this is to simply stay calm and look around you. Feel the environment, touch some objects, and walk around a bit. Once you get the hang of it, you can let your imagination run wild!
